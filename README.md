**Important Notice!**
If you installed this prior to February 17 2016 you have to uninstall everything, including any APIs created using 
these resources, before you upgrade. There has been a lot of changes and they are not backward compatible!

#API Gateway for CloudFormation
API Gateway for CloudFormation is a set of Custom Resources that allows you to manage your API Gateway setup
with CloudFormation. It is deployed with CloudFormation and runs on AWS Lambda.

The project is inspired by [AWS Labs API Gateway Swagger Importer](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-apigateway-importer) so you will see a lot of familiar syntax in the setup.

##A note on terminology before we begin
Throughout this document there are references to *resources* and *API Resources*.
It is very important to distinguish the difference between the two:

* A *resource* is a CloudFormation term and can refer to any AWS resource.
* An *API Resource* is a specific type of AWS resource (Custom::ApiResource) which is called "Resource" in API Gateway.

Confusing, I know...

##Installation
##Prerequisites
* You'll need an [Amazon AWS Account](http://aws.amazon.com).
* You need an IAM user with access/secret key, see required permissions below.
* You have to install & configure the [AWS-CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide)

###Setup IAM permissions
To be able to install the Custom Resource library you require a set of permissions.
Configure your IAM user with the following policy and make sure that you have configured your aws-cli with access and secret key.

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "cloudformation:CreateStack",
                    "cloudformation:DescribeStacks",
                    "iam:CreateRole",
                    "iam:CreatePolicy",
                    "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                    "iam:GetRole",
                    "iam:PassRole",
                    "lambda:CreateFunction",
                    "lambda:UpdateFunctionCode",
                    "lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

###Run the installation script

You no longer have to clone the repo to install!

Simply <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/apigatewaycloudformation/builds/v1.1.0.zip">download the installation package from the CDN</a>, unzip it and run the following command from your shell:

    npm run installation

Installation takes a couple of minutes and when it completes it will output the Custom Resource Lambda function ARN.
Save this value, it is the value of the ServiceToken parameter that each Custom Resource requires in your CloudFormation templates.
Once installation is done, run the following command to deploy the code:

    npm run deploy

####Options

If you want a custom name for your installation (default is ApiGatewayCloudFormation) you can set it by prepending 
the commands with NAME=MyCustomName. Note that the custom name has to be provided to all scripts.

    NAME=MyCustomName npm run installation
    NAME=MyCustomName npm run deploy

You can also install a specific version if you do not want to install the latest by specifying VERSION:

    VERSION=1.2.3 {NAME=MyCustomName} npm run deploy

For a list of available versions, please see the <a href="#change-log">Change Log</a>.

####Uninstallation
If you want to uninstall the setup you simply run:

    npm run uninstall

After you've run this command you can install a new environment if you want.
Note that uninstallation may take a minute or two.

If you provided a custom name during installation you have to provide the same name during un-installation:
 
    NAME=SomeOtherName npm run uninstall

**Note:** If you reinstall the setup you have to update the ServiceToken in your CloudFormation templates. 

#Usage   

##Overview
This setup allows you to manage the majority of the API Gateway releated resource. Below you'll find (hopefully) exhaistive documentation on how to use each resource type.

One thing that is not currently supported are API deployments. There is a bit of a catch-22 thing happening with the SDK and deployments where I can't create a stage without a deployment and I can create a deployment without a stage. I have this on the TODO list but for now you'll have to mange API deployment outside of this project.

Also note that some resources may be flagged as experimental which means that they haven't been tested thouroghly.

That said, on to what you can do.

##Create an API

Creates a new Api Gateway REST API
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/APIGateway.html#createRestApi-property

**Note:** The Custom Resource does not support API cloning. This is intentional.

###Parameters
**name:**
Name of the REST API.

* Required: *yes*
* Type: String
* Update: No interruption

**description:**
Name of the REST API. 
An optional description of your REST API.

* Required: no
* Type: String
* Update: No interruption, partial. You may add/change this property but not remove it. 

###CloudFormation example
    "TestRestApi" : {
        "Type" : "Custom::RestApi",
        "Properties" : {
            "ServiceToken": "{Lambda_Function_ARN}",
            "name": "Test API",
            "description": "This is a test API"
        }
    }

Outputs: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/APIGateway.html#createRestApi-property
In addition the parent resource id is also returned in the response:

    Fn::GetAtt: ["TestRestApi", "parentResourceId"]

##Create an API Resource

Creates a new API Resource in an existing API
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/APIGateway.html#createResource-property

**Note:** If you delete an API Resource from your CloudFormation template, all child resources are deleted by API Gateway.
This may create certain data inconsistencies between the actual API and what is believed to be setup from the Custom Resource perspective.
I therefor recommend that if you remove an API Resource from a tempalte, remove all child resources at the same time to ensure a consistent data model.

###Parameters
**restApiId:**

* Required: *yes*
* Type: String

* Required: no
* Type: String array
* Update: No interruption

**corsConfiguration.allowDefaultHeaders**
If you set *corsConfiguration.allowHeaders* and still want to include the default set of headers you can set this property
to true and the default headers will be appended to the headers you specified in *corsConfiguration.allowHeaders*

* Required: no
* Type: Boolean
* Update: No interruption

            "pathPart": "test",
            "corsConfiguration": {
                "allowMethods": ["GET", "POST"],
                "allowHeaders": ["x-my-header", "some-other-header"],
